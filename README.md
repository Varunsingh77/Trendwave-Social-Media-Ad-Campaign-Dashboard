# Optimizing Social Media Ad Campaign Performance for Audience Engagement and ROI
  Social Media Campaign Analytics – Power BI Dashboard

 #Project Overview

  This project analyzes the performance of a digital advertising campaign using Power BI. 
  The goal is to evaluate engagement (CTR), conversion (CR), and cost efficiency
  (CPA   & CPM) across different age groups and gender segments, enabling data-driven decisions 
  to optimize ad spend and targeting strategies.

 The dashboard was built using DAX in Power BI, with additional data cleaning and transformation done in Excel/Python.

# Business Objectives

1. Identify which age and gender segments drive the highest engagement and conversions.
 
2. Assess the efficiency of ad spend through CPA and CPM comparisons.

3. Provide actionable insights for targeting the most profitable customer segments.

4. Support data-driven campaign optimization for better ROI.

# Tools & Techniques

 Power BI - DAX calculations, interactive dashboard,
   Power Query for cleanning 

# Dashboard Features

1. CTR & CR Analysis by age group and gender.

2. CPA & CPM Trend Comparison to highlight cost efficiency.

3. Interactive filters & slicers for dynamic insights.

4. Visual storytelling to explain campaign performance patterns.

🔑 Key Insights

1. Females (30–34 years) recorded the highest CTR (strong engagement) but the lowest CR, meaning clicks are not effectively converting.

2. Males (35–39 years) showed both high CTR and CR, making them the most responsive and profitable target group.

3. Older groups (45–49 years) had lower CTR but higher CR, suggesting quality leads despite fewer clicks.

4. CPA was higher in younger age groups, indicating inefficient spend, while CPM was more balanced across demographics.

5. Actionable Insight: Reallocate ad budget toward males 35–39 for maximum ROI, while refining messaging for females 30–34 to improve conversions.
